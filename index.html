    <h2>About Jesse Dunn</h2>
    <p>I’m an Arizona native, born and raised in Phoenix, and now lucky to call Snowflake home.</p>
    <p>I’ve been a licensed real estate agent for nearly two years, and in that time, I’ve developed a specialty in land, off-grid properties, and homes across Northern Arizona. I’m known for going above and beyond for my clients, whether they’re buying their first property or selling a piece of land that’s been in the family for generations.</p>
    <p>I have a real passion for helping people through every step of the process. I still remember the excitement of buying my first home, and now I get to help others feel that same thrill.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re buying, selling, or just want to talk real estate — I’d love to connect!</p>
